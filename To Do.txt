  - Stress-test YOLO batch size limits in video.py. Now that the GPU scales the tensors down before 
    inference, monitor RTX 4060 VRAM usage and experiment with increasing BATCH_SIZE (from 4 to 8) to 
    maximize speed without triggering an Out-of-Memory error during the initial batch.float() conversion.
        -make batch size configurable in config.yaml

  - pushover notification option

  - add black/ruff

  - add RULE.md and .cursor/rules

  - if event starts with a car, have yolo track the car for that portion of the ai and video sumary, 
    but priortize people once they are in Frame

  - Determine if a person is the same individual across different camera views without making 
    assumptions
    - Cross-Camera Tracking   
        - Detection & Local Tracking:
            - Model: YOLO26m (for high-speed inference on 4060).
            - Tracker: StrongSORT or DeepOCSORT (for temporal consistency).
        - Re-Identification (Re-ID):
            - Encoder: OSNet or FastReID to generate 512/1024-dimensional embeddings.
            - Gallery: Centralized embedding database with a 5-minute rolling expiration.
        - Cross-Camera Logic:
            - Verification: Cosine similarity matching across camera streams.
            - Topology Constraints: Filter matches based on travel time and camera adjacency.
