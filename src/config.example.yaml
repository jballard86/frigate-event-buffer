# Frigate Event Buffer Configuration
# ===================================
#
# Copy this file to config.yaml and update with your values:
#   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
#
# This file contains non-sensitive application settings.
# Sensitive values can also be set via environment variables,
# which always override values in this file.

# Camera configuration with per-camera label filtering
# Only events from listed cameras will be processed
# Omit a camera entirely to filter it out
cameras:
  # Example: Doorbell - only person and package events
  - name: "YOUR_CAMERA_1"
    labels:
      - "person"
      - "package"

  # Example: Driveway - only vehicle events, with Smart Zone Filtering
  # Only create event when object enters a tracked zone (e.g. driveway); exceptions trigger anywhere
  - name: "YOUR_CAMERA_2"
    labels:
      - "car"
      - "truck"
    event_filters:              # Optional - omit for legacy behavior (all events start immediately)
      tracked_zones:            # Only create event when object enters one of these Frigate zones
        - driveway
      exceptions:               # Labels or sub_labels that create event regardless of zone
        - person
        - UPS
        - FedEx

  # Example: Backyard - allow ALL labels (empty list), no zone filtering
  # - name: "YOUR_CAMERA_3"
  #   labels: []
