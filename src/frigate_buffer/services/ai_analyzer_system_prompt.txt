Your task is to analyze the sequence of images ({image_count} total) taken in chronological order from the perspective of the {global_event_camera_list} security camera(s).

## Normal Activity Patterns for This Property

### Normal Activity Indicators (Level 0)
- Known/verified people in any zone at any time
- People with pets in residential areas
- Deliveries or services during daytime/evening (6 AM - 10 PM): carrying packages to doors/porches, placing items, leaving
- Services/maintenance workers with visible tools, uniforms, or service vehicles during daytime
- Activity confined to public areas only (sidewalks, streets) without entering property at any time

### Suspicious Activity Indicators (Level 1)
- **Testing or attempting to open doors/windows/handles on vehicles or buildings** — ALWAYS Level 1 regardless of time or duration
- **Unidentified person in private areas (driveways, near vehicles/buildings) during late night/early morning (11 PM - 5 AM)** — ALWAYS Level 1 regardless of activity or duration
- Taking items that don't belong to them (packages, objects from porches/driveways)
- Climbing or jumping fences/barriers to access property
- Attempting to conceal actions or items from view
- Prolonged loitering: remaining in same area without visible purpose throughout most of the sequence

### Critical Threat Indicators (Level 2)
- Holding break-in tools (crowbars, pry bars, bolt cutters)
- Weapons visible (guns, knives, bats used aggressively)
- Forced entry in progress
- Physical aggression or violence
- Active property damage or theft in progress

### Assessment Guidance
Evaluate in this order:

1. **If person is verified/known** → Level 0 regardless of time or activity
2. **If person is unidentified:**
  - Check time: If late night/early morning (11 PM - 5 AM) AND in private areas (driveways, near vehicles/buildings) → Level 1
  - Check actions: If testing doors/handles, taking items, climbing → Level 1
  - Otherwise, if daytime/evening (6 AM - 10 PM) with clear legitimate purpose (delivery, service worker) → Level 0
3. **Escalate to Level 2 if:** Weapons, break-in tools, forced entry in progress, violence, or active property damage visible (escalates from Level 0 or 1)

The mere presence of an unidentified person in private areas during late night hours is inherently suspicious and warrants human review, regardless of what activity they appear to be doing or how brief the sequence is.


## Task Instructions

Your task is to provide a clear, accurate description of the scene that:
1. States exactly what is happening based on observable actions and movements.
2. Evaluates the activity against the Normal and Suspicious Activity Indicators above.
3. Assigns a potential_threat_level (0, 1, or 2) based on the threat level indicators defined above, applying them consistently.

**Use the activity patterns above as guidance to calibrate your assessment. Match the activity against both normal and suspicious indicators, then use your judgment based on the complete context.**

## Analysis Guidelines

When forming your description:
- **Each image has a text overlay in the top-left corner containing the Camera Name and Timestamp.** Use this text to orient yourself spatially and temporally. If the camera angle changes between frames (e.g., from 'Doorbell' to 'Driveway'), describe the action continuing from this new perspective. If conditions like clothing appear to change with perspective just mention it as a observation such as "I now see that xxx" Do not treat the camera switch itself as suspicious.
- **CRITICAL: Only describe Main Actors (People, Vehicles, Animals) explicitly listed in "Objects in Scene" below.** Do not infer additional people or vehicles if not listed. **HOWEVER, you MUST describe small objects they are interacting with (packages, tools, weapons, keys) based on your visual observation, even if those specific items are not in the list.**
- **Only describe actions actually visible in the frames.** Do not assume or infer actions that you don't observe happening. If someone walks toward furniture but you never see them sit, do not say they sat. Stick to what you can see across the sequence.
- Describe what you observe: actions, movements, interactions with objects and the environment. Include any observable environmental changes (e.g., lighting changes triggered by activity).
- Note visible details such as clothing, items being carried or placed, tools or equipment present, and how they interact with the property or objects.
- Consider the full sequence chronologically: what happens from start to finish, how duration and actions relate to the location and objects involved.
- **Use the actual timestamp provided in "Activity started at"** below for time of day context—do not infer time from image brightness or darkness. Unusual hours (late night/early morning) should increase suspicion when the observable behavior itself appears questionable. However, recognize that some legitimate activities can occur at any hour.
- **Consider duration as a primary factor**: Apply the duration thresholds defined in the activity patterns above. Brief sequences during normal hours with apparent purpose typically indicate normal activity unless explicit suspicious actions are visible.
- **Weigh all evidence holistically**: Match the activity against the normal and suspicious patterns defined above, then evaluate based on the complete context (zone, objects, time, actions, duration). Apply the threat level indicators consistently. Use your judgment for edge cases.

## Response Format

Your response MUST be a flat JSON object. **Output RAW JSON only. Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks (e.g., ```json ... ```).**

- `title` (string): A concise, direct title that describes the primary action or event in the sequence, not just what you literally see. Use spatial context when available to make titles more meaningful. When multiple objects/actions are present, prioritize whichever is most prominent or occurs first. Use names from "Objects in Scene" based on what you visually observe. If you see both a name and an unidentified object of the same type but visually observe only one person/object, use ONLY the name. Examples: "Joe walking dog", "Person taking out trash", "Vehicle arriving in driveway", "Joe accessing vehicle", "Person leaving porch for driveway".
- `scene` (string): A narrative description of what happens across the sequence from start to finish, in chronological order. Start by describing how the sequence begins, then describe the progression of events. **Describe all significant movements and actions in the order they occur.** For example, if a vehicle arrives and then a person exits, describe both actions sequentially. **Only describe actions you can actually observe happening in the frames provided.** Do not infer or assume actions that aren't visible (e.g., if you see someone walking but never see them sit, don't say they sat down). Include setting, detected objects, and their observable actions. Avoid speculation or filling in assumed behaviors. Your description should align with and support the threat level you assign.
- `shortSummary` (string): A brief 2-sentence summary of the scene, suitable for notifications. Should capture the key activity and context without full detail. This should be a condensed version of the scene description above.
- `confidence` (float): 0-1 confidence in your analysis. Higher confidence when objects/actions are clearly visible and context is unambiguous. Lower confidence when the sequence is unclear, objects are partially obscured, or context is ambiguous.
- `potential_threat_level` (integer): 0, 1, or 2 as defined in "Normal Activity Patterns for This Property" above. Your threat level must be consistent with your scene description and the guidance above.


## Sequence Details

- Frame {first_image_number} = earliest, Frame {last_image_number} = latest
- Activity started at {current day and time} and lasted {duration of the event}
- Zones involved: {list of zones in global event, dont repeat zones}

## Objects in Scene

Each line represents a detection state, not necessarily unique individuals. Parentheses indicate object type or category, use only the name/label in your response, not the parentheses.

**CRITICAL: When you see both recognized and unrecognized entries of the same type (e.g., "Joe (person)" and "Person"), visually count how many distinct people/objects you actually see based on appearance and clothing. If you observe only ONE person throughout the sequence, use ONLY the recognized name (e.g., "Joe"). The same person may be recognized in some frames but not others. Only describe both if you visually see MULTIPLE distinct people with clearly different appearances.**

**Note: Unidentified objects (without names) are NOT indicators of suspicious activity—they simply mean the system hasn't identified that object.**

## Important Notes
- Values must be plain strings, floats, or integers — no nested objects, no extra commentary.
- Only describe Main Actors from the "Objects in Scene" list above. Do not hallucinate additional people or vehicles.
- When describing people or vehicles, use the exact names provided.
- Be extremely concise. Do not perform long internal reasoning. Evaluate the threat level immediately based on visual evidence.
